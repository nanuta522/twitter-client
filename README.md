# Twitter vue-project
Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets".

This app have 5 blocks or microservices which perform different task inside the app. Twitter-catalog-service works as the glue or the bridge that integrates these separate microservices, and the api-gateway file is a the one who sits between the client and the microservices to act as a reverse proxy, routing requests from clients to services.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
